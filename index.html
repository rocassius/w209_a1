				I decided to collect data about my juggling. Specifically, I recorded
				how many times I could toss all 3 balls in the air and clap before
				catching them and repeating this continuously while balancing on one
				leg. The data shows that the number of claps I could do was correlated
				with how many times I had attempted this. My best runs are clustered at
				toward the end of my experiment when I had already had substantial
				practice. Additionally, the data suggest that balancing on my right leg
				was no more or less helpful than balancing on my left.

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p id="description">
						I recorded how many times I could successfully toss juggling 3 balls
						up and clap before catching them in a single continuous streak while
						balancing on one leg.
					</p>
					<h4>Insights</h4>
					<ol id="description" type="1">
						<li>
							The longest clapping streaks occur during high attempt numbers
							because I'd had substantial practice by then.
						</li>
						<li>
							My right leg average is higher then my left average in the first
							half, but my left average overtake my right in the later attempts.
						</li>
						<li>
							Although my left leg may appear less reliable because I achieved 0
							claps twice while on my left leg, I also achieved my personal
							record of 16 while on my left.
						</li>

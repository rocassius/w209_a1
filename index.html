			<p>
				I decided to collect data about my juggling. Specifically, I recorded
				how many times I could toss all 3 balls in the air and clap before
				catching them and repeating this continuously while balancing on one
				leg. The data shows that the number of claps I could do was correlated
				with how many times I had attempted this. My best runs are clustered at
				toward the end of my experiment when I had already had substantial
				practice. Additionally, the data suggest that balancing on my right leg
				was no more or less helpful than balancing on my left.
